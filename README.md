## The Problem

The coronavirus pandemic created new restrictions that grocery stores and Supermarkets  have to work under: In Israel, a business must not hold more than 10 customers within the same store. It was also said that citizens should avoid leaving home as much as possible.

* Due to these new restrictions a large number of customers went through to place food orders through digital systems.

* Large food companies are unable to accept multiple orders at the same time, and hold a small number of delivery workers. Which leads to high orders delays, delays in deliveries, and inaccessibility at branches.

* At the same time, small grocery stores are losing their customers inability to make deliveries
